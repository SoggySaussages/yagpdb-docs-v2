# YAGPDB Docs v2

Experimental / proof of concept page to replace the current documentation which is built with GitBook.

This documentation is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) in conjunction with the [Doks theme](https://getdoks.org/) as
an experiment to see if it is a viable alternative.

## Contributing / Building

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), clone this repository, and use `npm run dev` to start a local server. The
server will automatically rebuild the page when you make changes.

To build the page in release mode, use `npm run build -- --baseURL ...`\*, then serve the generated `public/` directory
with your webserver of choice.

For more information, please view our [Contributing Guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

_\*Note the `--` is not a typo, but rather serves to pass `baseURL` to Hugo as opposed to the `npm run` command._

### Editor Setup

As this project used the [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) standard, you will have to make sure that your
editor supports it. Most modern editors do, but if you are unsure, check the EditorConfig page.

### Adding a new page

Pages are written in Markdown, with additional shortcodes provided by the Doks theme; refer to [its
documentation](<(https://getdoks.org/docs/start-here/getting-started/)>) for a complete list of features.
